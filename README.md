Basic concept learning in golang

Started: 2021-06-30
Purpose: Cover concepts in Golang (what can be done, what can't be done) one by one

After watching several YT videos on various aspects of Go, I have gotten a sense that most of the tutorials don't do two things: 1. Tell you a detailed list of what works and doesn't work in any given aspect of Go, and 2. cover strategy as to why I'd use a particular feature or pattern.  Essentially, the tutorials I've seen cover the middle ground, but miss the high and low ground.
My strategy on this is to take a given concept, tear it into pieces (down to the "low ground" so to speak), and then consider basic strategies had a complete view of what's happening below.
